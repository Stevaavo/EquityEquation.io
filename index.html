          <p class="lead">...is a mathematical method <a href="http://paulgraham.com/equity.html">proposed by Paul Graham</a> for determining a reasonable portion of equity to offer an employee or investor.</p>

<!--           <p>Graham published the equation a couple years after he co-founded Y Combinator.  It computes a suggested equity stake and salary for a new employee/investor as a function of the added value they're expected to bring to the company.</p>

            <p>Graham published the equation a couple years after he co-founded Y Combinator.  It can be used to compute a suggested equity stake and salary for a new employee as a function of the added value they're expected to bring to the company.</p>

            <p>You can read an in-depth explanation of how the equation works in Paul Graham's original blog post <a href="http://paulgraham.com/equity.html">here</a>.  I'd also recommend <a href="https://blog.keen.io/how-i-negotiated-my-startup-compensation-a291a9fb20a8">this excellent article from Michelle Wetzler</a>, which provides a walkthorugh of three different methods she used to evaluate her job offer - the Graham Equation, as well as two alternatives.</p>

            <p>The equation involves the 4 variables below.  By providing any 3 of these numbers, you can solve for the 4th number.</p>

                            <small><p>It can be hard to come up with this number. Think of it this way: startups only hire new people if they believe that adding them to the team will make the company more valuable. Every new hire brings something to the table - maybe they're a great engineer who will help them build a great product, or a really persuasive marketer who will help them boost sales, or an awesome janitor who will make the office a wonderfully clean place to work.  Their labor is worth something, and the company will be better off for hiring them.</p>
                            
                            <p>For this number, try to guess <em>how much</em> better off they will be, as a percentage.  If the new hire has some skills that are especially valuable and rare, or if they're joining a very small team, this number may be on the higher end - perhaps 10-30%.  Otherwise, perhaps it's just 1% or 5%.  Ultimately it's a guesstimate, but don't be modest!</p>

                  <p>The employee's annual salary is increased by this percentage for the purpose of the equation.  This is because an employee’s salary is paid every year, not just once.  In addition, the company will incur additional “overhead” costs from the new hire.  The salary multiplier accounts for those extra costs.</p>

                  <p>If you set this to zero, the Graham Equation would tell you how much equity an employee should receive in order to leave the company neither any better nor worse-off than they were before they hired him/her.  When you don’t account for profit, the Graham Equation calculates the “break even” number.  No company is interested in merely breaking even on a new hire, so this parameter specifies how much profit they want to make on their new employee.</p>
